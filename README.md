# The 'super' Gif App
I really didn't have any better idea for a name

This GIF app feeds from the Giffy API.
Its main functionality is to present a list of GIF and allow you to share and add those preferred gifs of yours to favourites.
I did this a long time ago to get an Android Developer Role in Freshworks Studio

The app, is a collection of all the knowledge I did gather (until 2021) since I started my career as an Android Developer.
It may be a bit outdated, but at that moment (2021), this is what I got into the app:

- Clean Architecture
- MVVM
- MVI
- Retrofit
- Room
- Paging Library
- ViewBinding
- XML

And a few other things I don't remember right now. 
I will get back to this project maybe some day in the future to finish the unit testings, add instrumented testings and change xml (ew) for Jetpack Compose (yaaas). 

"Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming." a quote from the programming god John Carmack.
Feel free to steal the sh_t out of this project if you find it useful.
